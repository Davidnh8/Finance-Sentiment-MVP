And Nvidia stock rose on the back of those sales. So are you saying Nvidia needs to give up that market?  
Just wait for investigation to be over and actually see if any laws were broken. Nvidia already made a public statement that it does not see any illegal activity.

DeepSeek AI just caused shockwaves in the stock market—some companies soared while others crumbled. Who came out on top?  

With Nvidia and Meta caught in the upheaval, AI’s market influence is undeniable. Investors are watching closely—where’s the smart money going next?

Did DeepSeek AI Just Dethrone Nvidia $NVDA Stock?  

They're developing their own GPUs China is close to chip production as good as Nvidia, so they will bypass them  
That might have an effect like oh maybe collapsing a stock.

$NVDA stock's like a plot twist in a movie - you think it's down for the count, then BAM! It's back with a vengeance, proving once again that in the AI world, Nvidia's the hero we didn't know we needed. Here's to betting on AI's favorite chip champ! $DELL  

. Yep, was pretty happy to find mine at MRSP D1 back then.  
But here clearly no stock, kind of a mess from Nvidia. Like 250 for every distributor in the US for the 5090, etc.  
It's all the influencers that got the cards 😂
